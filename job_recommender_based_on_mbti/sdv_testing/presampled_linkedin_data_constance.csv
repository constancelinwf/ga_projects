data_scientist," As I desperately cling to my 20s, here are 29 + 1 things I’ve learned during my time on this planet that have lead to success. Always ask questions! The stupider the question the better! Don’t ask what’s the least I can do. Ask what’s the most I can bear! Your body is powerful. Move every day! You can’t overcome a weak body with a powerful mind! Hug a dog, laugh with a child, make a stupid joke! Social capital is more important than financial capital. If you have a ton of friends, money will come. Try your hardest every day. Some days that means giving 10% because that’s all you got! Help the less fortunate. Mentoring and teaching gives me a ton of joy . Learn SQL as soon as possible. Invest in the stock market as soon as possible. Buy the best laptop you can afford. You’re an artist who deserves the best paint brushes! The people who stay in your life are meant to be there. The ones who leave, let them leave. When you interview, never accept the first offer. Companies ALWAYS leave negotiation wiggle room. Make sure to get it. When you interview, run one mile before it. This activates your brain, reduces your anxiety and increases your confidence. Dont tolerate a bad manager. Start interviewing the second you’re mistreated. And even before then! Never stay longer than 2 years at a job. Something better will come along. Never renew a lease. Living somewhere new every year keeps you sharper because you have to relearn to live. Be gentle with yourself when you make mistakes. You’ll find bravery in that gentleness! Be grateful for the little things. The hand most of us were dealt was extremely good Forgive your parents. They were just kids too when they raised you. Forgiving them gives you power back over your life! Stop hanging out with friends who only want to party. If your friends aren’t going what you want to do, find new friends. Quit your job and take a risk. You might just make a million dollars. Strength training is as important as cardio! Don’t skip leg day! "

teacher,"I am always amazed by how our in-house curriculum specialists weave in exciting current affairs topics to make learning relevant and relatable to our students. I truly believe that learning should not just be preparing our students for their exams, but also to ignite their curiosity to learn more about the world around them. During my English lessons with my students, I jump at opportunities to talk about relevant current affairs topics. These often lead to lively classroom discussions where my students get the chance to enhance their communication skills and develop their abilities to express their opinions persuasively too!"
teacher,"AI will indeed transform how work evolves. Education, as an enabler for learners to work in the future and as work for educators at present, will also be evolved by AI. While the Internet is argued as the backbone of the fourth industrial revolution, AI could become the fifth industrial revolution depending on how we get it right with the evolution of AI. "

The people who tend to think that they are invaluable are typically the ones who create the most stress by creating firestorms and creating drama and making things more difficult for me. If you're a drama creator, you're not going to do well. If you are stress reducer, you're going to do well.” — I cannot agree more we need such"

teacher,"Took myself out on a date today just to reflect on the work year that has passed and to take stock of life. A lot has been said about self-care and work-life balance but of course we all know that it's much easier said than done. The reality on the ground is that we tend to get caught up in the busyness of work and the never-ending deadlines, and neglect ourselves to the point of exhaustion. How do we dial back, while still remaining productive? How do we gather the courage to take our foot slightly off the pedal while still staying on course? Well I think for me it's about practising what I preach. I keep telling my students that they have to go out and play a little, to experience life in all of its glory instead of fretting over their books every day. And that's something that I will remember in the year to come too. To breathe, to pause, to carve time out to sit and muse. And then to go back ready to take on the next challenge. Wish me luck and happy holidays everyone (:"
