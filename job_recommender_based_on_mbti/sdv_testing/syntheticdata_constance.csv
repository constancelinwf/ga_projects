3,data_scientist,"A lot of people comment on my content wanting to know if data engineering will be around in the next few years because they want to know if its a good career choice. But tech careers rarely seem to go in a straight line. For example here is my experience over the last near decade. 2014, like many others I read the HBR article and decided I wanted to work in data science. 2015, I started my career as a project analyst that got pulled into building C# websites and working on data science problems such as detecting readmission of patients. 2016, I got my first job as a data engineer at a healthcare analytics company. 2017, I helped develop a product focused on detecting fraud in healthcare. This was where I first learned about making data into an actual product. 2018, I took a job at Facebook as a data engineer. I quit my job at Facebook to be a full-time consultant that has helped in everything from traditional data engineering/data science work to strategic initiatives. Consulting is still a major part of my work but I also write, create youtube videos, help companies find the right messaging for their solutions, and so much more. A lot is changing. What you like to do and the way people drive value will change along with it."

13,accountant,"I actively participated in a pivotal data migration project focused on operations reports, contributing significantly to the successful transition from legacy systems to the implementation of Power BI.

17,teacher,"Took myself out on a date today just to reflect on the work year that has passed and to take stock of life. A lot has been said about self-care and work-life balance but of course we all know that it's much easier said than done. The reality on the ground is that we tend to get caught up in the busyness of work and the never-ending deadlines, and neglect ourselves to the point of exhaustion. How do we dial back, while still remaining productive? How do we gather the courage to take our foot slightly off the pedal while still staying on course? Well I think for me it's about practising what I preach. I keep telling my students that they have to go out and play a little, to experience life in all of its glory instead of fretting over their books every day. And that's something that I will remember in the year to come too. To breathe, to pause, to carve time out to sit and muse. And then to go back ready to take on the next challenge.

25,software_engineer," As I desperately cling to my 20s, here are 29 + 1 things I’ve learned during my time on this planet that have lead to success. Always ask questions! The stupider the question the better! Don’t ask what’s the least I can do. Ask what’s the most I can bear! Your body is powerful. Move every day! You can’t overcome a weak body with a powerful mind! Hug a dog, laugh with a child, make a stupid joke! Social capital is more important than financial capital. If you have a ton of friends, money will come. Try your hardest every day. Some days that means giving 10% because that’s all you got! Help the less fortunate. Mentoring and teaching gives me a ton of joy . Learn SQL as soon as possible. Invest in the stock market as soon as possible. Buy the best laptop you can afford. You’re an artist who deserves the best paint brushes! The people who stay in your life are meant to be there. The ones who leave, let them leave. When you interview, never accept the first offer. Companies ALWAYS leave negotiation wiggle room. Make sure to get it. When you interview, run one mile before it. This activates your brain, reduces your anxiety and increases your confidence. Dont tolerate a bad manager. Start interviewing the second you’re mistreated. And even before then! Never stay longer than 2 years at a job. Something better will come along. Never renew a lease. Living somewhere new every year keeps you sharper because you have to relearn to live. Be gentle with yourself when you make mistakes. You’ll find bravery in that gentleness! Be grateful for the little things. The hand most of us were dealt was extremely good Forgive your parents. They were just kids too when they raised you. Forgiving them gives you power back over your life! Stop hanging out with friends who only want to party. If your friends aren’t going what you want to do, find new friends. Quit your job and take a risk. You might just make a million dollars. Strength training is as important as cardio! Don’t skip leg day! "
26,software_engineer,"Hey everyone, it's unfortunate but I'm one of the many impacted by the recent layoffs at Indeed. It's incredibly sad to lose almost all of the Singapore office in this event.

86,data_scientist," As I desperately cling to my 20s, here are 29 + 1 things I’ve learned during my time on this planet that have lead to success. Always ask questions! The stupider the question the better! Don’t ask what’s the least I can do. Ask what’s the most I can bear! Your body is powerful. Move every day! You can’t overcome a weak body with a powerful mind! Hug a dog, laugh with a child, make a stupid joke! Social capital is more important than financial capital. If you have a ton of friends, money will come. Try your hardest every day. Some days that means giving 10% because that’s all you got! Help the less fortunate. Mentoring and teaching gives me a ton of joy . Learn SQL as soon as possible. Invest in the stock market as soon as possible. Buy the best laptop you can afford. You’re an artist who deserves the best paint brushes! The people who stay in your life are meant to be there. The ones who leave, let them leave. When you interview, never accept the first offer. Companies ALWAYS leave negotiation wiggle room. Make sure to get it. When you interview, run one mile before it. This activates your brain, reduces your anxiety and increases your confidence. Dont tolerate a bad manager. Start interviewing the second you’re mistreated. And even before then! Never stay longer than 2 years at a job. Something better will come along. Never renew a lease. Living somewhere new every year keeps you sharper because you have to relearn to live. Be gentle with yourself when you make mistakes. You’ll find bravery in that gentleness! Be grateful for the little things. The hand most of us were dealt was extremely good Forgive your parents. They were just kids too when they raised you. Forgiving them gives you power back over your life! Stop hanging out with friends who only want to party. If your friends aren’t going what you want to do, find new friends. Quit your job and take a risk. You might just make a million dollars. Strength training is as important as cardio! Don’t skip leg day! "

Initially, as a Relationship Manager, I honed my skills in managing a diverse portfolio of clients, ensuring their unique banking needs were consistently met.

Subsequently, during my 2.5-year tenure as a Trade Finance Specialist, I took on the vital responsibility of facilitating the financial requirements of importers and exporters.

193,software_engineer,"A lot of people comment on my content wanting to know if data engineering will be around in the next few years because they want to know if its a good career choice. But tech careers rarely seem to go in a straight line. For example here is my experience over the last near decade. 2014, like many others I read the HBR article and decided I wanted to work in data science. 2015, I started my career as a project analyst that got pulled into building C# websites and working on data science problems such as detecting readmission of patients. 2016, I got my first job as a data engineer at a healthcare analytics company. 2017, I helped develop a product focused on detecting fraud in healthcare. This was where I first learned about making data into an actual product. 2018, I took a job at Facebook as a data engineer. I quit my job at Facebook to be a full-time consultant that has helped in everything from traditional data engineering/data science work to strategic initiatives. Consulting is still a major part of my work but I also write, create youtube videos, help companies find the right messaging for their solutions, and so much more. A lot is changing. What you like to do and the way people drive value will change along with it."
